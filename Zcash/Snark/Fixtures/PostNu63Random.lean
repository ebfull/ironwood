# Post-NU6.3 provenance for the random match-only captures

The random captures (`Fixtures/SingleActionRandom`, `…/MultiActionRandom`,
`…/TripleActionRandom`) run the deployed verifier on random proof strings, so no accepting
evaluation binds their URS the way `capturedMsm_eval_eq_zero` binds the honest captures'. Their
URS story is cross-capture identity: each random dump lists the same URS and verifying-key
commitment points as the honest single-action capture (the equalities below), and that capture's
URS is in turn bound by its accepting evaluation and by the Lean-derived commitments of the
boundary statements. The random families' verifying-key certificates
(`Fixtures/*/VkCertificate.lean`) transport the single-action keygen certificate along these
equalities, exactly as `Fixtures/MultiAction/VkCertificate.lean` does.

This file is separate from `Fixtures/PostNu63.lean` so the honest multi-action certificate,
which imports that file, does not pick up a build dependency on the three random fixture data
modules. The honest single-action capture is the shared right-hand side throughout, matching the
direction convention there.
